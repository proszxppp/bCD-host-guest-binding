# bCD-host-guest-binding
This folder contains the GAFF2 and FM parameter sets for the macrocyclic host bCD used in our work on enhanced sampling simulations of bCD host-guest binding.
The translational diffusion of the guest is accelerated, and the binding/unbinding events are sampled extensively. 
The asymmetric structure of the host leads to the directionalized guest coordination behavior. This primary-secondary equilibrium is taken into consideration in the computation of binding affinity, and the relative stability of the primary- and secondary-binding modes is calculated.
